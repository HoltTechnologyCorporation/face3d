# face3d

## Author: Ian Gillingham 
HTML Framework for reading, rendering and manipulating a given obj file (head3d).


## Overview
A task has been given to render an OBJ 3D image file of a person's head.
The brief is as follows:
>Use any technology that you think is relevant to display the provided 
colour 3D model (in the link below) in a website, the user should be 
able to rotate the face model and zoom with a mouse. Also Provided 
within the link is a file which includes the feature points for the 
given face. Calculate the distance between the center of the left pupil 
to the center of the right pupil (in a straight line) and display the 
measurement result on the page, whichever way you see fit?"

## Build Setup

No build required. The code simply needs uploading to a suitable directory on a web-server.

## Deployment
The code has been deployed on Ian Gillingham's own web server:

## Caveats
This has been an interesting exercise. Given the very short timescale available, 
the code had to be rapidly developed and is not of optimal design, simply a proof of concept.
